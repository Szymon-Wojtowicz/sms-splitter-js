    const K = 12;
    const messageCount = solution(S, K);
    console.log(`SMS: ${S}`);
    console.log(`Number of SMS messages needed: ${messageCount}`);
    /* Given the input parameters S = "SMS messages are really short" and K = 12, the solution() function will return 3.
    This is because the input string can be split into three separate messages as follows:
    "SMS"
    "messages are"
    "really short"
    Each of these messages has a length of 12 or less, and they cannot be further divided without breaking up a word.
    Therefore, the function returns the minimum number of SMS messages needed to accommodate the whole text, which in this case is 3. */
