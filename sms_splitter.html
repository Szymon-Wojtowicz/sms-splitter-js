    /* Given the input parameters S = "SMS messages are really short" and K = 12, the solution() function will return 3.
    This is because the input string can be split into three separate messages as follows:
    "SMS"
    "messages are"
    "really short"
    Each of these messages has a length of 12 or less, and they cannot be further divided without breaking up a word.
    Therefore, the function returns the minimum number of SMS messages needed to accommodate the whole text, which in this case is 3. */

    // This input is longer than 12 characters, so the function splits it into multiple SMS messages. In this case, it takes four SMS messages to send the entire message:
    // "The quick", "brown fox", "jumps over" and "the lazy dog". Therefore, the function returns 4.

    // "Lorem ipsum", "dolor sit", "amet", "consectetur", "adipiscing" and "elit". Therefore, the function returns 6.

    const S6 = "This is a very long message that needs to be split into multiple SMS messages in order to send it to my friend";
    const K6 = 12;
    const messageCount6 = solution(S6, K6);
    console.log(`SMS: ${S6}`);
    console.log(`Number of SMS messages needed: ${messageCount6}`);
    // S = "This is a very long message that needs to be split into multiple SMS messages in order to send it to my friend", K = 12: This input is longer than 12 characters, so the function
    // splits it into multiple SMS messages. In this case, it takes ten SMS messages to send the entire message:
    // "This is a", "very long", "message that", "needs to be", "split into", "multiple SMS", "messages in", "order to", "send it to", "my friend". Therefore, the function returns 10.

    const S7 = "There are no two consecutive spaces in this message";
    const K7 = 12;
    const messageCount7 = solution(S7, K7);
    console.log(`SMS: ${S7}`);
    console.log(`Number of SMS messages needed: ${messageCount7}`);
    // This input is longer than 12 characters, so the function splits it into multiple SMS messages. In this case, it takes five SMS messages to send the entire message:
    // "There are no", "two", "consecutive", "spaces in", "this message". Therefore, the function returns 5.

    const S8 = "AND HERE IS LAST TEXT";
    const K8 = 12;
    const messageCount8 = solution(S8, K8);
    console.log(`SMS: ${S8}`);
    console.log(`Number of SMS messages needed: ${messageCount8}`);
    // This input is longer than 12 characters, so the function splits it into multiple SMS messages. In this case, it takes two SMS messages to send the entire message:
    // "AND HERE IS", "LAST TEXT". Therefore, the function returns 2.
